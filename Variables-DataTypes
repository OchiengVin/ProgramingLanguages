//Role of Variables and Data types
Role of Variables:

Variables are named memory locations that can hold data values. They provide a way to access and manipulate data in a program.
Variables are declared with a name and a specific data type. The name is used to reference the variable throughout the program.
Variables can be assigned values, and these values can change during the program's execution, making them dynamic containers.
They allow programmers to work with data in a more structured and organized manner.

Role of Data types:

Data types define the kind of data that a variable can hold. They determine the range of values and the operations that can be performed on the data.
Common data types include integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and boolean values.
Data types provide constraints on what you can do with data, which helps catch errors early in the development process and optimize memory usage.
Different programming languages support various data types, and some even allow user-defined data types.

//How Variables and Data types are used to store and Manupulate data

For Storing Data:

Variables are used to store data of specific types. For example, you might use an integer variable to store whole numbers and a string variable to store text.
By declaring the appropriate data type for a variable, you ensure that the variable can only store values of that type, which helps prevent data-related errors.

For Manipulating Data:

Data types determine the operations that can be performed on variables. For instance, you can perform arithmetic operations on integer and floating-point variables, but not on string variables.
Variables can be updated, reassigned, or modified to perform various computations and transformations on the stored data.
You can use conditional statements, loops, and functions to control the flow of the program and manipulate data based on certain conditions.
